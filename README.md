# ðŸš€ Fairlaunch Memecoin: A True Decentralized Asset  

This ERC-20 token is built using the OpenZeppelin library. It deploys on a network with Uniswap v3 and initializes a liquidity pool, depositing the entire supply into a single-sided position.  

This ensures **a fully permissionless digital asset** with **no owner privileges**â€”everyone has equal rights and access on Uniswap to buy, sell, and speculate freely.  

## ðŸ”§ Deployment  

Run the following commands to test and deploy on the Mumbai network:  

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
